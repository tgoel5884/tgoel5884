# Hi folks 👋

I'm a Pursuing Undergraduate Student in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with
passion for new technologies, and always learning to add new skills in my skill set.
I am a hardworking person but a believer in working smart. Always prepared to face
any challenges in my life, and I see them as opportunities that give me a chance to
learn and grow. As of now, I have spent almost 2 years in learning engineering
concepts and technologies related to Data Structure and Algorithms as well as in
Python. I am also an active competitive coder, and fond of Problem Solving. My next
step is towards learning Data Science for Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning.
